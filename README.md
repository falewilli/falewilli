### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Information Technology and integrated marketing communications professional with more than 25 years of experience. Highly creative yet very analytical, with excellent interpersonal communication and problem solving skills. Driven by a deep devotion for technology, I love to work with clear objectives, multidisciplinary teams and I am always willing to innovate and streamline processes through continuous improvement. I never take anything for granted, just the fact that things can always be done in a better and in a more efficient way.

Now I am on a path to become a Full Stack Developer and be a part of this incredible universe that is programming, which is something I've always wanted. I remember coding my first video games in Basic language on a Texas Instruments TI-99/4A when I was just a kid. Â¡Good old days! Fortunately today thanks to this coding bootcamp in which I enrolled, the possibility of fulfilling that dream has been placed within my reach, and I am going to grab it!

See you on the other side ;)
